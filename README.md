# Greenify

## Overview
Greenify is an AI/ML project focused on urban/rural scene segmentation in high-resolution remote sensing images, specifically analyzing greenery and environmental features to determine the locations to plant seeds for the cause of afforestation. It leverages the SFA-Net architecture to perform semantic segmentation of satellite and aerial imagery.

## Features
- Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images
- Customized identification of vegetation, buildings, roads, water bodies, and other urban features
- Test-time augmentation for improved prediction accuracy
