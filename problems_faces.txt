Issues in this:
-> Not robust enough so added various augmentations.
-> There are cases when a lot of the area is being predicted as clutter so i set a relative margin threshold on the clutter class in the predictions.
-> finding proper dataset 
-> Not having NIR reading which are very beneficial coz the images are just 3 channels so have to use heavy augmentations to make the model not dependent on just the colors of different classes.
-> Watermarks in image have a great impact on the predictions of the model.
